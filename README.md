My final assignment for CS250 was reflecting on the scrum events and different roles we took part in during the course. Interpreting user goals and ensuring you meet customer needs was crucial during these events. Creating user stories helped our users interact with our team and open up a good line of communcation in what they were expecting and looking for in our project. 
I approach developing programs one step at a time. I truly try and break every project down into as small steps as possible, giving myself manageable steps along the way. Agile processes I hope to incorporate would be testing cosntantly and frequently. That is a very important step for ensuring no bugs make it into your deployed and submitted code. 
Being a good team member is absolutely vital for not only our success but your teams success in a project. Being a good team member means being up front about issues or roadblocks, and constantly communcating within your team. It also means absorbing as much information as possible when approaching a team lead or manager with questions.
